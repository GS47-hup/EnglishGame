## ⚠️ **CRITICAL TEACHER REMINDER: "THIS IS" vs "THESE ARE"**

**Students MUST differentiate:**
- **"THIS IS"** = ONE item → "This is a book" / "This is my father"
- **"THESE ARE"** = MULTIPLE items → "These are books" / "These are my parents"

**Common mistakes:** ❌ "This is books" → ✅ "These are books"

**Goal:** Students choose correct form naturally by end of review.
