  - **Column 1**: Subjects - People and animals (dog, teacher, cat, girl, horse, boy, bird, mother, fish, father, elephant, student, cow, sister, pig)
  - **Column 2**: Actions - Verbs and abilities (running, eating, jumping, swimming, walking, sleeping, flying, reading, writing, drawing, dancing)
  - **Audio Instructions**: Complete sentences like "The dog is running", "The teacher is eating", "The girl is swimming"
  - **Student Task**: Draw lines connecting subjects to their actions based on audio instructions

#### Added - Comprehensive Action Vocabulary System
- **🎯 Curriculum-Aligned Actions**: Used action verbs and abilities from established word bank
  - **Base Actions**: run, eat, jump, swim, walk, sleep, fly, read, write, draw, dance
  - **Progressive Forms**: running, eating, jumping, swimming, walking, sleeping, flying, reading, writing, drawing, dancing
  - **Subject Variety**: Mixed people (teacher, mother, father, girl, boy, sister, student) and animals (dog, cat, horse, bird, fish, elephant, cow, pig)

#### Added - Interactive Line Drawing System
