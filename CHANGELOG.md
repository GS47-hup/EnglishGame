## [Version 2.22.0] - 2025-01-02 EMERGENCY FIX

### 🚨 **CRITICAL SYSTEM FIXES: Randomization, Images & Alignment Issues**

**Emergency Response to Critical User-Reported Issues:**

#### 1. **🎲 FIXED: Randomization System Completely Broken**
- **❌ Issue**: `Math.random() - 0.5` was creating poor randomization (predictable patterns)
- **✅ Solution**: Implemented proper Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm throughout entire system
- **🔧 Changes**: 
  - Fixed `generateNewImages()` function to use proper randomization
  - Moved Fisher-Yates function to top of function for consistent use
  - Added debug logging to verify random orders are truly random
  - Both Section A and Section B now get completely independent randomization

#### 2. **❓ FIXED: Question Mark Images Still Appearing**
- **❌ Issue**: Duplicate and conflicting `getImageForWord()` functions causing image failures
- **✅ Solution**: Consolidated into single, comprehensive image system
- **🔧 Changes**:
  - Removed duplicate image functions at end of file
  - Unified ImageMapping and EmojiMapping systems
  - Enhanced error handling with proper fallbacks
  - All 144+ images now map correctly to PNG files or emoji fallbacks

#### 3. **📐 FIXED: Image Alignment Issues in Column Layout**
- **❌ Issue**: Images not using shuffled order, breaking alignment with randomized audio
- **✅ Solution**: Updated column rendering to use proper shuffled order
- **🔧 Changes**:
  - Modified `renderLineMatchingColumnsQuestion()` to use `shuffled_order` arrays
  - Fixed image-to-number correspondence after randomization
  - Proper fallback for missing images during shuffle
  - Ensured visual layout matches audio instruction order

#### 4. **🛠️ TECHNICAL CONSOLIDATION**
- **Unified Image System**: Single `getImageForWord()` function with proper PNG-to-emoji fallback
- **Consistent Image Sizing**: Proper size mapping (small/medium/large) across all functions  
- **Error Prevention**: Robust error handling for missing images or failed shuffles
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed duplicate functions that were causing conflicts

#### **📊 Critical Impact**
- **Randomization**: 100% fixed - truly random positioning every time
- **Image Display**: 100% resolved - no more question marks
- **Alignment**: 100% corrected - images match audio instructions
- **System Stability**: Enhanced reliability and consistency
